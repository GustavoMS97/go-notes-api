# Go Notes API

A simple and complete Notes API written in **Go**, following clean architecture principles, built for learning and portfolio purposes.

This project simulates a real-world backend service with:

- ‚úÖ JWT authentication (access + refresh token strategy)
- ‚úÖ Full CRUD for Notes
- ‚úÖ MongoDB for persistence
- ‚úÖ Swagger documentation
- ‚úÖ Environment variables support via `.env`
- ‚úÖ Modular code with proper folder structure (like NestJS-style)
- ‚úÖ Dockerized for easy deployment (e.g. Render, Railway, etc.)

## üìå Goal

> Apply real-world backend architecture using Go.

The goal of this project is to gain hands-on experience with Go by building a production-like API that covers:

- Authentication with hashed passwords
- Middleware for auth protection
- A service-repo pattern
- MongoDB integration with models
- A clean and scalable file/folder structure
- Deployment using Docker

## üöÄ Running Locally

### 1. Clone the repo
```bash
git clone https://github.com/GustavoMS97/go-notes-api
cd go-notes-api
```

### 2. Setup environment
Create a `.env` file:
```env
PORT=4000
ENV="development"
DATABASE_URL="mongodb+srv://<user>:<pass>@cluster.mongodb.net"
DATABASE_NAME="go-notes-api"
JWT_SECRET="your_super_secret_key"
SWAGGER_HOST="127.0.0.1:4000/api"
```

### 3. Run the app
```bash
make run
```

Swagger docs will be available at: `http://localhost:4000/docs/index.html`

---

## üê≥ Docker

### 1. Build image
```bash
docker build -t go-notes-api .
```

### 2. Run container
```bash
docker run -p 4000:4000 --env-file .env go-notes-api
```

You can now deploy this on platforms like **Render**, **Railway**, **Fly.io**, etc.
